# This Is the Fight of Our Generation
Dearest Beat Saber Community,

Thank you for giving us your time this Earth Day. I live on a tropical island with a literal rainforest behind my house. The natural world, with all its strange plants and marvelous animals, is dear to me and many others. And as 1 million plant and animal species face extinction due to the climate crisis, I cannot sit and watch as time runs out.

Many sleepless nights went into this campaign, out of the hope that some of you will leave knowing you can make a difference, that together we can make a difference.

Like the two of us, you probably play Beat Saber quite competitively. Many of you are among the best in your country, even the world and some of you will be playing for your country soon. To have reached this level of skill, you were probably driven, you persevered in the face of adversity, and you believed you were doing something worth your time (and money) that would pay off in the end.

While we laugh, scream, and swing away in VR, reality still exists outside… and it could really use some help right now. As you’ve heard more times than you’ve grinded Chocolate Lily, **we are in a climate emergency**. It is real and it is dire. **In the words of the UN chief, it “is a code red for humanity.”**

Around the world, temperatures and weather are becoming more extreme. Wildfires, hurricanes, and floods are more frequent and devastating. The Arctic is thawing. Look at this diagram and see the direction we are heading.

Although things are not looking so good (an understatement), we have not yet lost. Scientists have been screaming at us: **we still have time, we can still make it... but as the human race, we really need to focus and get our act together because this is a window we cannot afford to miss.**

**So what can you do?**
- **To truly win this battle, we need to get industry to change.** Vote for scientifically literate politicians. Ask existing leaders regardless of their affiliation to enact effective climate policies.
- **Get others to care and take action.** Help more people understand why climate change affects them and what they can do to help. The people you help will go on to help others.
- **Do what you can, you don't have to be perfect.** The fight is monumental but don’t give in to apathy because your voice and contributions matter.

If you find yourself thinking or being told you can't make a difference, remember this: The abilities that brought you to this game come from you who exists outside. If you can fight this hard for internet glory, you are equally capable of fighting at least as hard for the survival of the human race. Why not spare some of that strength and passion for fixing our climate? Would it not pay off to have a more habitable world in the end?

Please join us (and your local efforts) in the fight for our future, our Earth, and all lives on it and to come. Let's cut emissions and excessive resource consumption like we cut those blocks - with conviction and dedication in the right direction. May our and your aim be true.

~ Zeph
